		\begin{procedure}
			\begin{proceduregroup}{Base}
				\step Heat oven to 180ÂºC.
				\step Separate egg yolks from the egg whites.
				\step Add a small amount of the sugar to the yolks and whisk lightly.
				\step Slowly whisk the vegetable oil into the yolks.
				\step Add the milk to the cocoa powder bit by bit while stirring with a whisk.
				\step Add the cocoa powder mixture to the egg yolks and mix evenly.
				\step Sift the flour into the yolk mixture and mix.
				\step Mix the remaining sugar into the egg whites and whisk with an electric mixer. Beat on low speed, then high and finish again with low for a more stable consistency. Stop when you reach soft peaks that droop but do not fall off.
				\step Add a third of the egg whites to the egg yolk mixture and combine the result after mixing with the rest of the egg whites.
				\step Pour the batter into a baking pan lined with parchment paper. Repeatedly drop the baking pan a short distance onto the counter to get rid of any bubbles.
				\step Place into the preheated oven and bake for 15 minutes.
				\step Once ready, remove the cake base from the oven and quickly remove the parchment paper. Straighten out and cool on a cooling rack.

			\begin{proceduregroup}{Mousse}
				\step Cut gelatin sheets into smaller pieces and soak in cold water until softened.
				\step Remove gelatin from water and squeeze to remove excess water.
				\step Microwave milk and add the gelatin. Mix until the gelatin is dissolved completely.
				\step Pour the warm gelatin milk into the room temperature mascarpone, mix evenly.
				\step Add sugar and mix until completely dissolved.
				\step Whip cream. Make sure not to whip the cream too stiff, but only until the surface is textured.
				\step Mix cream with mascarpone mixture in stages.
				\step Cut the cake base into the shape of the cake mould by pressing the mould into the base.
				\step Make sure the cake base is securely at the bottom of the cake mould.
				\step Pour the mousse into the cake mould in stages, adding a little bit of cocoa powder each time.
				\step Refrigerate for at least four hours, ideally over night.
